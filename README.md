# amazon-lex-bot-test

This is an example script to demonstrate how one can regression test an Amazon Lex bot. It relies on the AWS SDK and the [Amazon Lex Runtime Service API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/API_Operations_Amazon_Lex_Runtime_Service.html).

The user must have [IAM permissions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/access-control-managing-permissions.html#access-policy-examples-aws-managed) to invoke the API functions (e.g., `AmazonLexReadOnly`).

## Updates

### August 14, 2020

Changed logic to compare post condition when a Lex response has multiple messages by adding post conditions to an array and comparing against response by index.

Example of the business case: [{ "Hi there" }, { "Here's more information" }, { "And more" }]
